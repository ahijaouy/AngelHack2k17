# iOS Swift App To Identify Trash, Recyclables, and Compostables

As part of the AngelHack Sillicon Valley 2017 we build an iOS app that leverages an Express backend and Google Vision API in order to classify items into trash, recyclables, and compostables. This App is also synced with a Particle Photon that activates LEDs corresponding to the items classification.
